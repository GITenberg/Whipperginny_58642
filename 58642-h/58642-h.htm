<h2><a name="AUTHORS_NOTE" id="AUTHORS_NOTE"></a>AUTHOR’S NOTE</h2>

<p>The poems in this volume cover a period of three years, beginning at the
New Year of 1920, except for the rhymes “Henry and Mary,” “What did I
dream?” and “Mirror, Mirror!” with parts of “An English Wood,” “The Bed
Post” and of “Unicorn and the White Doe,” which are bankrupt stock of
1918, the year in which I was writing <i>Country Sentiment</i>. <i>The Pier
Glass</i>, a volume which followed <i>Country Sentiment</i>, similarly contains
a few pieces continuing the mood of this year, the desire to escape from
a painful war neurosis into an Arcadia of amatory fancy, but the
prevailing mood of <i>The Pier Glass</i> is aggressive and disciplinary,
under the stress of the same neurosis, rather than escapist.
<i>Whipperginny</i> for a while continues so, but in most of the later pieces
will be found evidences of greater detachment in the poet and the
appearance of a new series of problems in religion, psychology and
philosophy, no less exacting than their predecessors, but, it may be
said, of less emotional intensity. The “Interlude” in the middle of the
book was written before the appearance of these less lyrical pieces, but
must be read as an apology for the book being now even less homogeneous
than before. To those who demand unceasing emotional stress in poetry at
whatever cost to the poet&mdash;I was one of these myself until recently&mdash;I
have no apology to offer; but only this proverb from the Chinese, that
<i>the petulant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> protests of all the lords and ladies of the Imperial
Court will weigh little with the whale when, recovering from his painful
excretory condition, he need no longer supply the Guild of Honourable
Perfumers with their accustomed weight of ambergris</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">On the High Feast Day in that reverent space<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Between the Sacrifice and the word of Grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I, come to town with a merry-making throng<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To pay my tithes and join in the season’s song,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Closing my eyes, there prayed&mdash;and was hurried far<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Beyond what ages I know not, or what star,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To a land of thought remote from the breastplate glint<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the white bull’s blood that flows from the knife of flint,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then, in this movement, being not I but part<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the fellowship of the universal heart,    <span class="linenum1">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">I sucked a strength from the primal fount of strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I thought and worked omnipotence. At length<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hit in my high flight by some sorry thought<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Back to the sweat of the soil-bound I was caught<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And asked in pique what enemy had worked this,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What folly or anger thrust against my bliss?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then I grew aware of the savour of sandal-wood<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With noise of a distant fluting, and one who stood<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nudging my elbow breathed “Oh, miracle! See!”<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The folk gape wonder, urge tumultuously,    <span class="linenum1">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">They fling them down on their faces every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Some joyfully weep, others for anguish moan.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Wavers and stirs, we see his raiment twitch.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now he stands and signs benediction with his rod.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The courtyard quakes, the fountains gush with blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The whistling scurry and throb of spirit wings<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Distresses man and child. Now a bird-voice sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a loud throat bellows, that every creature hears,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span><span class="i4">A sign to himself he must lay aside his fears.    <span class="linenum1">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">It babbles an antique tongue, and threatening, pleads<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Prompt sacrifice and a care for priestly needs,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wholeness of heart, the putting away of wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A generous measure for wine, for oil, for cloth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A holding fast to the law that the Stones ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the rites of the Temple watch that ye maintain<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lest fire and ashes down from the mountain rain!<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To his priestly servants hearken!<br /></span>
<span class="i15">The syllables die.    <span class="linenum1">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now up from the congregation issues a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As of stopped breath slow released. But here stands one<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who has kept his feet though the others fell like stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who prays with outstretched palms, standing alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To a God who is speechless, not to be known by touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">By sight, sound, scent. And I cry, “Not overmuch<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Do I love this juggling blasphemy, O High Priest.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or do you deny your part here? Then, at least,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">An honest citizen of this honest town<br /></span>
<span class="i4">May preach these nightmare apparitions down,    <span class="linenum1">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">These blundering, perfumed noises come to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i4">No more than a priest-instructed folk knows well.<br /></span>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
